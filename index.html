   I have never written up anything in HTML before, so I am going to play with a few features, such as this horizontal line:

   <hr>

   <h1>Large heading</h1>
   <h2>Smaller heading</h2>
   <h3>Even smaller heading</h3>

   <del>I'm going to cross this out.</del>

   I hear you should <mark>highlight</mark> important things, such as <mark>look to the right!</mark>.
   
   <p style="text-align:right;">This should be right justified.</p>

   <I>Italics look nice...</I> <u>and so do underlines...</u> <b>and bold...</b> but what about <I><b><u>TRIPLE THREAT</u></b></I>
   <br>

   This is a picture of a giraffe:

   Note: I figured out how to do most of this stuff through the website https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/21-basic-html-codes-everyone-whos-not-a-developer-should-know
